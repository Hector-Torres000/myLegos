So the major proble about this is that
you can't decide the starting and ending colors of
the text. You kinda have to know about your colors
and when I mean know, I mean you have to know about
color saturation, hue, contrast, the "adding and
subtracting" colors and knowing a lot of other stuff.

I spend about 5+ hours trying to learn how to 
find another way of doing this using purely CSS 
and HTML but unfortunately. I felt like I wasted my
day. 

But with every "failure" there is a lesson to learn.
I learned more about positioning and how absolute, 
relative, and sticky values affect one another.

But the most important lesson is that, if I don't
get it and I spend an hour on it. MOVE ON!!!
