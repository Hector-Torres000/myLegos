HOVER1 

part1****
this one is based on the CSS tricks code, this one
consisted of having a 'box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 0' with the 
apporpriate color and a 'transition: all' because
when hovered it changes the 'color' and 
'box-shadow' properties.  
The 'box-shadow: inset 300px 000 color' that first
value is the X value and thus is not really dynamic;
that's why i prefer my method.

part2***
part2 is similar to that of the other hover affects.
This one needs the 'a' to have 'position: relative',
'display: inline-block', and 'overflow: hidden'. 

I will also need the psuedo element with 'position: absolute',
'width: 100%', 'height: 100%', and a postition towards the left.
This also requires the 'transform: translateX(-100%)' with an
'z-index: -1'
On hover, anchor element has 'color: white' and on the 
psuedo-element 'transform: translateX(0)'
