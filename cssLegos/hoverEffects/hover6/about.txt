PART1::
Part1 consists of doing stuff from part7 hover effect. This 
is where I have two psuedo-elements using '::after' and '::before'
and have them stack on top of each other.
Just like part7-hover, the anchor tag has a 'position: relative'
with the psuedo-elements have a 'position-absolute'. One of them
has an 'z-index: -1' to be placed bellow the other one. The 
background psuedo-element is using a 'background-color' while
the other one is using a 'background-image' of a 'linear-gradient'

PART2::
Part2 uses two 'background-images' consisting of 'linear-gradient'.
Just like 'background-images' we can apply a 'background-repeat: none'
to prevent the image taking up 100% of the heigth and width of the
container. 
I would like to point out that you can have more that one
'background-image' by sepperating them by commas. ON the note
of linear gradients; there is syntax to follow that it requires
at least two declarations of colors to work. 
For the transition affect, you need both to be placed at the bottom
but only having one have a 'width: 100%', both 'heigth' properties
should be the same. 
NOTE that the 'background-position' is crucial to define where
the animation takes place. 1st value is X axis, 2nd value is Y axis
For the transition, use the 'transition: background-size' because
that is property you want to change, make one background image small
and other one big. DON'T FORGET THE 'transition' property.
