PART 4 HOVER
This hover affect is pretty simple compared to the other
ones I have done. Though my version of it is different
from that of CSS tricks.
MY PART:
My part consist of adding a 'linear-background' have it 
have a size of 100% width and the height to be just
generally small. Then use 'background-position' to 
place it wherever you want. Use the 'transtion: background-size'
and on 'hover' selector the 'background-size: 100% 100%'
CSS PART: 
They used the psuedo-element '::before' with 'position: absolute'
'z-index: -1' with a height and width that matches my own part
that does increase in size when on 'hover'.
