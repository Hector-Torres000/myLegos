The first link is using a background image(linear gradient)
to appear like a underline. You will need to have that be sized
to be small enough and then use repeat-X(or repeat-y) to strech the 
entire link. Most importantly you will need to position that image at
the desired side of the link.
Obviously text-decoration set to none with the color of your choice.
Most importantly is to have a transition, focusing on the background-size.
On hover, that background size will grow that it reaches the entire link.
