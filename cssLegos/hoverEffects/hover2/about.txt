PART2:
This part was slightly tricky as it required the
usage of a 'span' element surrounding the text of 
the anchor element. This hover affect is basically
have a psuedo-element to be hidden over on one side
of the anchor tag and when hovered, it moves in place
of the text and the original text moves to the side.

First, we have to have that anchor element to have
'overflow: hidden', 'position: relative', and 
'display: inline-block'. I assume that the 'display'
property is there to move items to the side without
overlapping each other.

The psuedo-element 'a::after' requires the 
'content: "[text]"' to have the same text of the
anchor tag. Then use the 'transform: translateX(100%)'
to move that psuedo-element to the right. On 'hover'
'transform: translateX(0)' to move it infront of the
anchor text. 

Finally, on the 'span' element needs 'display: inline-block'
property and on 'hover' use 'transform: translateX(-100%)'
to move it to the left.
