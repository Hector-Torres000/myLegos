PART5

So the part5 was a lot tricky and I still don't really understand it.
The CSS tricks explains it really tricky and I prefer my explaination 
of it. 
The Hover effect on the text where it changes color from one side to
the other, requires a 'background: linear-gradient()' with 90deg
and a hard line cut of two colors at 50%. The trick here is that
the 'linear-gradient' needs to be 200% in size. The reason behind this
is because the 'color' property will have the value of 'transparent';
meaning that the text color is the color of 'linear-gradient'. 
HOWEVER, you would need the 'background-clip' property set to 
'text' because we want that 'background: linear-gradient()' to be
shown only on the text.
Finally, we would need to add the 'transition' property to affect 'all'
and the ':hover' selector will then have the 'background-position: 100%'.
For some reason, this moves the 'linear-gradient' to the left...so yeah.

The other part is like hover#6 and hover#7 of having a psuedo element
appear at the bottom and increase its width.
